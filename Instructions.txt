Here’s a step-by-step guide you can save as a `.txt` file for setting up your Python 3.10 environment, virtual environment, and installing project requirements:

***

**Python 3.10 Setup & Virtual Environment Instructions**

1. **Download and Install Python 3.10**
   - Get the installer from: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/
   - IMPORTANT: During installation, check the box to “Add Python 3.10 to PATH”.

2. **Open a terminal (PowerShell or CMD)**

3. **Navigate to your project folder**
   ```powershell
   cd path\to\your\project
   ```

4. **Create a new virtual environment using Python 3.10**
   - If you have multiple Python versions, use the Python launcher:
     ```powershell
     py -3.10 -m venv environment
     ```
   - If only one Python, use:
     ```powershell
     python -m venv environment
     ```

5. **Activate the virtual environment**
   - PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     .\environment\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - CMD:
     ```cmd
     environment\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```
   - Bash (macOS/Linux):
     ```bash
     source environment/bin/activate
     ```

6. **Upgrade pip (recommended)**
   ```powershell
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

7. **Install all requirements from requirements file**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r environment/requirements.txt
   ```
   *or use `requirements.txt` if file is in the root folder*

8. **Verify installation**
   ```powershell
   python --version
   pip list
   ```

You can copy and save these steps to a file named, for example, `setup_instructions.txt`. Let me know if you want this as a formatted text file or with project-specific filenames!
