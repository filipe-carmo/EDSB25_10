HR Attrition Project

I. Introduction and Methodology 

The objective of this capstone project is to synthesize and apply the diverse skills and knowledge you have acquired throughout your coursework. You will
develop an end-to-end data science solution focused on predicting employee attrition. The project is designed to challenge you to integrate your
understanding of data exploration, feature engineering, machine learning, and model deployment. Additionally, you will refine your ability to communicate
complex results through a polished, professional presentation.



II. The Business Problem


High turnover rates are costly and disruptive, making it essential for HR to anticipate which employees are likely to leave. We are tasked with assisting a multinational consultancy firm in predicting employee attrition.

The primary goal is to predict whether an employee will leave the company, based on the data provided. Secondary goals include identifying key factors influencing attrition and recommending strategies to retain valuable employees.

The HR department and executive management will be the primary consumers of your insights, and they expect actionable recommendations based on your analysis.
